## What is the project?
This is a data analytics team project we did for IC2025, a one-week competition aimed to expose students in real-life problems. The main goal of the project is to analyze the public DC WMATA Metro Average Ridership data to analyze trends across a time period across different stations.  Perform exploratory data analysis to find trends, patterns, outliers, etc. and see if teams can formulate guesses on why those trends or outliers happened.

## Use of AI
We used ChatGPT and Perplexity AI to gain insight on various things such as potential causes of annually rise during October and the quality of other metro systems in the United States. Additionally, we used ChatGPT to generate and debug part of our programs. None of the materials other than actual codes were generated by AI.
